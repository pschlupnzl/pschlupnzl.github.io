## Welcome

My passions are science, software, and the visual media.

I have been an experimental photonics researcher, using lasers
to study atoms, molecules, and cells.
I have been a software engineer building tools for teaching
math, science, and languages to students old and young.
I have been a film school student, shooting, editing, and
crewing short film shoots.

I want to build solutions that make peoples' lives easier,
more efficient, and more fun.
I want to write software that's so interactive and intuitive
that you can use it almost with a sense of touch.
I want to create visual media that entertains and informs,
making complex concepts accessible without dumbing them down.
